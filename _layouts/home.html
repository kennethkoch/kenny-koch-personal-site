            Hey, welcome to my website!<br><br>

            I'm a software engineer with a background in full-stack web dev.<br><br>
            I'm currently studying ml and working on a few side projects which I plan to publish soon.<br>
            I'm also interested in math, physics (especially space stuff), and consciousness.
            <br><br>
            Feel free to check out my <a href="https://github.com/kennethkoch">GitHub</a> too.
