            Hey, welcome to my website!<br><br>
            I am an engineer trying to build stuff where bits meet atoms.<br><br>

            My background is in full-stack software engineering/web dev, but lately I have become
            obsessed with hard tech and I'm working on leveling up in embedded systems and
            robotics.<br><br>
            When I have more to show the world I will post it here.
            <br><br>
            Feel free to check out my <a href="https://github.com/kennethkoch">GitHub</a> too.
            <br><br>
