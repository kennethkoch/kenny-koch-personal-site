            Hey, welcome to my website!<br><br>

            I'm a software engineer trying to build cool stuff and learn as much as possible
            along the way.<br><br>
            I'm currently studying ml and working on a few side projects which I plan to publish soon.<br>
            I'm also interested in physics (especially space stuff), sci-fi, and all types of deep tech.
            <br><br>
            Feel free to check out my <a href="https://github.com/kennethkoch">GitHub</a> too.
            <br><br>
